# SoloFounder Agent Folder
Purpose: quick-start kit for the agent-based team described in the `solofounder` document. This folder centralizes who each agent is, what they own, what they need to act, and where to find source context.

## Contents
- `agents.md` — per-agent briefs (mission, responsibilities, inputs/outputs, escalation, references).

## How to use
- Founder/Sprint Coordinator assigns tasks using the briefs and routing cues.
- Each agent reads its section in `agents.md`, grabs the listed inputs, and produces the outputs before handoff.
- Escalate per-agent rules; log decisions in the shared decision log (see `solofounder`).

## Source references
- Primary: `solofounder`
