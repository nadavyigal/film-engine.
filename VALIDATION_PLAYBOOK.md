## Part 2: Outreach Scripts

### DM Template (Reddit/Twitter)

**Subject:** Quick question about your [AI video consistency] post

```
Hey [Name],

I saw your post about [specific pain point quote]. I've been hearing this from a lot of creators lately.

I'm building a tool that specifically solves the character consistency problem for serialized AI video content (think TikTok series, YouTube shorts).

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week? I'd love to understand your workflow and show you what I'm working on.

No sales pitch - just genuinely trying to understand if this is a problem worth solving.

[Calendar link]
```

**Response Rate Target:** 50% (15 responses from 30 contacts)

### Interview Scheduling Response

**When they reply "yes":**

```
Amazing, thank you! Here's my calendar: [link]

To make the best use of our 15 minutes, would you mind sharing:
1. What type of content are you creating? (TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
2. How often do you run into this consistency issue?

Looking forward to it!
```

## Part 3: User Interview Guide

### Pre-Interview Prep

**Materials to Have Ready:**
- Figma mockup of MVP (Scene Builder, Timeline, Export)
- Note-taking doc with template
- Timer (keep to 15 minutes)

### Interview Script (15 minutes)

**Opening (1 minute):**
```
"Thanks for taking the time. I'm [name], and I'm researching whether there's a real market for AI video tools that maintain character consistency across scenes.

I'm going to ask you about your experiences, then show you a quick mockup and get your honest feedback. Sound good?"
```

**Discovery Questions (8 minutes):**

1. **Context:**
   "Tell me about the type of content you're creating with AI video tools."
   - Listen for: Serialized vs. one-off, platform (TikTok/YouTube), frequency

2. **Pain Point:**
   "Walk me through the last time you struggled with character consistency. What exactly happened?"
   - Listen for: Specific workflow breakdown, time wasted, emotional reaction

3. **Current Solution:**
   "What did you try to fix it? How well did that work?"
   - Listen for: Workarounds, tools used, success rate

4. **Impact:**
   "How much time would you say you lose to this problem per project?"
   - Listen for: Hours per week, opportunity cost, frustration level

5. **Willingness to Pay:**
   "If there was a tool that solved this perfectly, how much would it be worth to you per month?"
   - Listen for: Price range, budget constraints, value perception

**Show Mockup (3 minutes):**

"Let me show you what I'm thinking of building..."

[Share screen with Figma]

"It works like this:
1. You upload 3-5 images of your character
2. You write scene prompts like normal
3. The tool automatically maintains consistency across all scenes
4. You see a timeline of all your scenes and can export

What's your reaction?"

**Listen for:**
- "This would save me so much time" (positive)
- "I'm not sure I'd use this" (negative)
- "I wish it also did X" (feature request)

**The Ask (2 minutes):**

"Here's the deal: I'm building this, and I want to get it in the hands of real creators ASAP.

The plan is to charge $20/month when it launches in about 4 weeks.

If you pre-pay $20 today, you'll get:
- First access to the beta
- Lifetime locked-in pricing at $20/month (never goes up)
- Direct line to me for feature requests

Basically, you're betting $20 that this will save you more than $20 worth of time. And if it doesn't, I'll refund you.

Are you in?"

**Objection Handling:**

"I need to think about it"
→ "Totally fair. What would make this a 'hell yes' for you?"

"$20 is too much"
→ "What price would feel right?" (explore willingness to pay)

"I want to see it first"
→ "I get that. The bet I'm making is that you've already wasted $20 worth of time on this problem. If I'm wrong, full refund."

"Can I get it for free?"
→ "Not for the beta, but there will be a free tier later. The $20 is really about making sure I'm building this for people who actually need it."

**Closing (1 minute):**

"Thanks for your time. Even if you're not ready to pre-pay, can I follow up with you when it's ready?"

[If YES to pre-pay: Send Stripe payment link immediately]
[If NO: Add to waitlist, note objections]

## Part 6: Decision Framework (End of Week 2)

### The Math

**Target:** 10 pre-payments = $200

**What 10+ means:**
- You've validated a painful problem
- People will pay to solve it
- You have your first customers waiting
- → BUILD THE MVP

**What 5-9 means:**
- Weak signal, not strong enough
- Dig deeper: Was it the price? The feature set? The user segment?
- Options:
  1. Change the offer (different price/features)
  2. Change the user segment (TikTok → Filmmakers)
  3. Reframe the problem (not consistency, but workflow)

**What 0-4 means:**
- Problem not painful enough OR solution not compelling
- → PIVOT or KILL
- Pivot options:
  1. Different feature (storyboarding, not generation)
  2. Different user (B2B, not creators)
  3. Different problem (editing, not creation)

## Part 7: Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall #1: "Everyone says it's a great idea"
**Reality:** "Great idea" ≠ "I will pay for this"
**Fix:** Always ask for money, not validation

### Pitfall #2: "They said they'd pay $50/month!"
**Reality:** Hypothetical willingness ≠ actual payment
**Fix:** Collect payment during the call, not "later"

### Pitfall #3: "I found 100 people complaining!"
**Reality:** Complaining ≠ desperate for solution
**Fix:** Only count people who pre-pay

### Pitfall #4: "I'll just build it and show them"
**Reality:** Building without validation = wasting time
**Fix:** Mockup is enough to validate concept

### Pitfall #5: "I need more data"
**Reality:** Seeking certainty where none exists
**Fix:** 10 pre-payments is enough signal to proceed

---

## Part 8: Backup Plan

### If You Can't Get 10 Pre-Payments

**Option 1: Pivot the Feature**
- Instead of "character consistency," offer "AI storyboarding"
- Instead of "scene generation," offer "timeline management"
- Run validation again

**Option 2: Pivot the User**
- Instead of TikTok creators, target filmmakers
- Instead of creators, target marketers
- Run validation again

**Option 3: Pivot the Business Model**
- Instead of SaaS, offer done-for-you service
- Instead of self-serve, offer consulting
- Run validation again

**Option 4: Kill the Idea**
- Accept that the problem isn't painful enough
- Move to next idea
- You saved $960K by finding out in 2 weeks

---

## Part 9: Week 2 Deliverables

By end of Week 2, you should have:

**Documents:**
- [ ] Spreadsheet with 30 complainers + URLs
- [ ] 15 interview notes
- [ ] Feature request summary (patterns across interviews)

**Metrics:**
- [ ] Interview completion rate: [X]/15
- [ ] Pre-payment conversion rate: [X]/15
- [ ] Total revenue: $[X]
- [ ] Average willingness to pay: $[X]

**Decision:**

- [ ] KILL: 0-4 pre-payments → Next idea

---

## Part 10: Success Stories (What to Look For)

### Strong Signal:
> "I literally spent 8 hours yesterday trying to keep my character's face the same. Where do I pay?"

### Weak Signal:
> "Yeah, that's annoying sometimes. Let me think about it."

### Red Flag:
> "Cool idea, but I'd probably just use the free version."

### Green Flag:
> "Can I pay for my friend too? She needs this."
