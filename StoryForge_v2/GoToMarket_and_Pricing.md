## Pricing & Packaging (Post-MVP)

> ⚠️ **Unit Economics Note:** Original Pro pricing (200 scenes for $50) is unprofitable at current API costs (~$0.40/scene). Revised tiers below maintain ~20% gross margin.

| Tier | Price | Scenes | Overage | Margin Target |
|------|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 5/mo | N/A | Marketing cost |
| **Creator** | $20/mo | 40 | $0.60/scene | ~$4 (20%) |
| **Pro** | $50/mo | 100 | $0.50/scene | ~$10 (20%) |

**What's Included:**
- **Free:** 5 scenes/month, watermark, 1 project, no templates; goal = top-of-funnel + feedback.
- **Creator:** 40 scenes/month, no watermark, unlimited projects, template access, style presets, standard queue.
- **Pro:** 100 scenes/month, priority queue, higher resolution exports, early access to features, email support.

**Add-ons:**
- Scene packs: 20 scenes for $15 (one-time, no expiration)
- Team seats: Deferred to post-PMF

## Offers & Conversion
- **Early-access lock-in:** $15/mo lifetime price for first 50 paying users (Creator tier locked; charged only after beta trial).
- **Refund promise:** 30 days, no questions asked, after first charge to reduce friction.
- **Upgrade nudges:** Show credit burn-down; suggest plan upgrades at 20% credits remaining.
- **Overage warning:** Notify at 80% usage with upsell to next tier OR scene pack.

### Conversion Funnel Targets
| Stage | Target | Metric |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Visitor → Signup | 10% | Signups / unique visitors |
| Signup → First Scene | 60% | Activated / signups |
| First Scene → 10 Scenes | 40% | Power users / activated |
| 10 Scenes → Paid | 30% | Paid / power users |
| **Overall Visitor → Paid** | **0.7%** | Industry benchmark: 0.5-2% |

## Messaging
- Hook: “Keep your characters and story beats consistent across scenes in minutes.”
- Proof: Show before/after clips and real timelines; highlight time saved and reduced retries.
- Contrast: “We are the workflow + narrative layer; Runway/Pika do the rendering.”
