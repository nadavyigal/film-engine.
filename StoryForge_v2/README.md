## Quick Start
1. Read `Product_Strategy_V2.md` to understand the thesis
2. Review `Execution_Roadmap_16w.md` for the full timeline
3. Start Phase 0 using `Customer_Research_Log.md` search queries
4. Track progress in `@plan.md`

## Guiding Principles
- Solve one painful workflow first; expand only after paid validation.
- Keep architecture and team small until PMF signals are undeniable.
- Treat every phase as an experiment with explicit success thresholds.
- **Validate demand before building** — Phase 0 desk research gates MVP development.
- **Unit economics must work** — revised pricing targets 20% gross margin.
