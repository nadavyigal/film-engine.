*(Add rows as needed; target 30+)*

### Pattern Summary (Entries 1-10)
- Majority pain on Runway/Pika; drifts show up after 2-6 shots, burning credits/time.
- Common failure modes: hair/face swaps, outfit/armor color changes, facial feature shifts mid-sequence.
- User types skew to short-form video (TikTok/Reels/YouTube Shorts) plus indie film and ad editors.
- Time/credit waste repeatedly noted; frustration about having to rerun 5-12 times per sequence.
- Stronger severity (7-9) when client work or paid ads are involved.

### Pattern Summary (Entries 11-20)
- Runway/Pika dominate mentions; ControlNet/SD video also surfaces but with similar face drift after keyframes.
- Failure modes: facial structure shifts (nose/jaw), hair/skin tone changes, wardrobe flips, stability drops after 3-8 seconds.
- Segments remain short-form heavy (TikTok/Reels/YouTube) plus agencies and music video editors handling client work.
- Credit/time burn continues (5-10 credits per sequence); seeds and reference uploads not solving drift.
- Users explicitly request a "lock" or "freeze" control for character continuity across shots.

### Pattern Summary (Entries 21-30)
- Same themes: Runway/Pika face drift after shot 2-3; wardrobe/skin tone/age shifts persist.
- Short-form creators and agency editors remain primary; seeds and refs still not solving continuity.
- Credit/time waste is explicit (10-15 credits per sequence); users ask for a simple lock/freeze control.

### Tally Snapshot (Phase A desk research)
- Tools mentioned: Runway (15), Pika (13), SD/ControlNet video (2)
- Segments: short-form creators (13), agency/commercial/DP (5), music video (3), film/short film/indie VFX (7), other (2)
- Severity: avg ~7.2/10 across 30 complaints
- Failure modes: face structure shifts, hair/skin tone changes, wardrobe flips, drift after shot 2-3; seeds/refs not solving
- Cost/time signals: 5-15 credits and ~2-4 hours wasted per sequence

- Scheduling ask: "Tue/Thu slots: 10:00, 12:30, 17:00 PT. Pick one and I’ll send a quick calendar hold."

## Decision Memos

### Phase A Decision (Week 2)
- **Date:** 2024-12-12 (desk research complete; calls deferred)
- **Complaints collected:** 30/30

- **Avg willingness:** n/a (no calls yet; inferred medium-high from outreach interest)
- **Result:** GO (with validation risk flagged: no live calls yet)
- **Rationale:** Repeated, recent complaints across Runway/Pika with high severity and credit/time waste; consistent requests for a “lock/freeze” control.
- **Next actions:** Proceed to Phase 1 build setup; keep passive monitoring; schedule 5-8 discovery calls in Phase B to de-risk before launch.

### Phase B Decision (Week 10)
- **Date:**
- **Demo calls completed:** __/15
- **Commitments secured:** __/10
- **Avg demo reaction:** __/10
- **Result:** GO / PIVOT / KILL
